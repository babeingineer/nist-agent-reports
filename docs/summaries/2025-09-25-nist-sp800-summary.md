  - _Mapping:_ NIST 800-53, SA-12

### Dependencies/Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- **Generate and maintain an accurate SBOM**, ensuring all components are tracked for security vulnerabilities and updates.
  - _Mapping:_ NIST 800-53, CM-2

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)/Cloud
- **Pilot comprehensive strategy for IaC to manage configurations and security settings** efficiently across all cloud resources.
  - _Mapping:_ NIST 800-53, CM-2

### Data/Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) & Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- **Secure CUI and PII by enhancing data handling practices** within development and deployment phases to prevent unauthorized access or breaches.
  - _Mapping:_ NIST 800-171 (related controls can be identified upon further detail on data requirements)

### Testing/Assurance
- **Strengthen developer testing frameworks** to include checks for security patch reliability and software integrity before release.
  - _Mapping:_ NIST 800-53, SI-7
- **Increase rigor in validation processes** to confirm that security features work as expected post deployment.
  - _Mapping:_ NIST 800-218 SSDF, PS.3
